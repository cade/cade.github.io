title: Cade Truitt’s Résumé
---

<section>
  <h2 class="no-print">Hi, I’m Cade</h2>
  <p>I’ve been developing products for the web for almost 20 years. While I’ve worked with an extensive list of technologies in that time, my primary focus has been full-stack engineering with Ruby on Rails. I have worked remotely for over a decade and am motivated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive:_The_Surprising_Truth_About_What_Motivates_Us">autonomy, mastery, and purpose</a>. Learning new things keeps life interesting for me.</p>
  <p>Whether it’s defining and leading new projects, helping teams collaborate, or diving directly into the codebase, I’m someone who gets shit done. I enjoy sharing my expertise with others and have mentored numerous engineers both professionally and as a volunteer. I’m always advocating for simple solutions that are approachable to others. Lately, I’m intrigued by the benefits of using <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">ai</acronym> for increasing my own productivity.</p>

  <h2>Places I’ve Worked</h2>
  <h3><a href="https://goodenough.us/">Good Enough</a> <span class="date">Sep 2024 – Present</span></h3>
  <h4>staff engineer</h4>
  <p>Good Enough is my first experience with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy">Holacracy</a>. While there are a <a href="https://goodenough.us/lab/">handful of products</a> at Good Enough, my main focus is <a href="https://letsjelly.com/">Jelly</a>, a shared inbox for small teams. Jelly is built on a pretty standard Rails stack, backed by PostgreSQL, and makes extensive use of WebSockets via Turbo. In my time with Good Enough, I learned <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#appendix-A.5">more than I ever imagined I’d know</a> about email, shipped multiple features, fixed several show-stopping performance issues (including memory leaks and slow database queries), hosted numerous customer demo calls, and even dipped a few toes into Marketing.</p>

  <h3><a href="http://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a> <span class="date">Feb 2014 – Sep 2024</span></h3>
  <h4>senior software engineer / engineering manager</h4>
  <p>Over the course of 10+ years at Harvest, I had the opportunity to work on a little of everything across a wide range of technologies (Ruby/Rails, MySQL/Percona, Redis, Sidekiq, Kafka, Docker, Backbone, React/RTK, TypeScript, various AWS/Google Cloud offerings, the list goes on!) at a notable scale (e.g. tables with north of a billion rows). Working closely with Quality Engineers and Product Designers, I led teams in building a long list of customer-facing features and integrations. I identified and shipped many orders of magnitude performance improvements. I squashed myriad bugs. I learned tons.</p>
  <p>I also spent a couple of years at Harvest as an Engineering Manager overseeing a team of eight engineers. I performed weekly 1-on-1s, semiannual performance reviews, and provided mentorship and oversight. I also worked closely with the leadership team to help define and implement several new processes for how we worked on product development as an organization that led to successful deliveries of multiple, longstanding feature requests.</p>
